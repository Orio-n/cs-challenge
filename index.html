                This method uses different feature maps with multi-scale
                receptive fields to detect multiscale impact craters from
                remotely sensed planetary images. Moreover, semantic
                segmentation models based on U-net have been presented to detect
                craters. Silburtet et al. proposed DeepMoon based on the U-net
                network structure to recognize lunar craters from DEM data. This
                successfully achieved a recall rate of 81.2% and a precision
                rate of 75.4% in lunar crater recognition when training 30,000
                DEM data images. Furthermore, to explore craters on Mars,
                DeLatte et al. employed segmentation convolution neural networks
                based on U-net for automatic crater detection from Martian
                daytime infra-red images. This method identified 65-75% of
                craters in common with a human-annotated dataset, and used the
                ResUNET model to detect craters with the global maps and
                infra-red imagery for Mars

                  The successful use of CNNs for classification started in 2015

                  Applying this research has the potential to reduce the time
                  spent counting craters by hand, provide a more consistent
                  application of a crater counting technique (labeling varies
                  between experts and even between areas done by the same

              <p>
                Machine learning has the potential to help map and classify a
                large variety of both features and properties on the surface of
                Mars and to aid in the planning and execution of future
                missions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here, we outline the current extent of machine learning as
                applied to Mars, summarize why machine learning should be an
                important tool for planetary geomorphology in particular, and
                suggest numerous research avenues and funding priorities for
                future efforts. We conclude that: (1) moving toward methods that
                require less human input (i.e., self- or semi-supervised) is an
                important paradigm shift for Martian applications, (2) new
                robust methods using generative adversarial networks to generate
                synthetic high-resolution digital terrain models represent an
                exciting new avenue for Martian geomorphologists, (3) more
                effort and money must be directed toward developing standardized
                datasets and benchmark tests, and (4) the community needs a
                large-scale, generalized, and programmatically accessible
                geographic information system (GIS).

                Deep Domain Adaptation for Detecting Bomb Craters in Aerial
                Images
              </h3>
              <p>
                The aftermath of air raids can still be seen for decades after
                the devastating events. Unexploded ordnance (UXO) is an immense
                danger to human life and the environment. Through the assessment
                of wartime images, experts can infer the occurrence of a dud.
                The current manual analysis process is expensive and
                time-consuming, thus automated detection of bomb craters by
                using deep learning is a promising way to improve the UXO
                disposal process. However, these methods require a large amount
                of manually labeled training data. This work leverages domain
                adaptation with moon surface images to address the problem of
                automated bomb crater detection with deep learning under the
                constraint of limited training data. This paper contributes to
                both academia and practice by providing a solution approach for
                automated bomb crater detection with limited training data and
                by demonstrating the usability and associated challenges of
                using synthetic images for domain adaptation.

                Autonomous crater detection on asteroids using a

              </h3>
              <p>
                This paper shows the application of autonomous Crater Detection
                using the U-Net, a Fully-Convolutional Neural Network, on Ceres.
                The U-Net is trained on optical images of the Moon Global
                Morphology Mosaic based on data collected by the LRO and manual
                crater catalogues. The Moon-trained network will be tested on
                Dawn optical images of Ceres: this task is accomplished by means
                of a Transfer Learning (TL) approach. The trained model has been
                fine-tuned using 100, 500 and 1000 additional images of Ceres.
                The test performance was measured on 350 never before seen
                images, reaching a testing accuracy of 96.24%, 96.95% and
                97.19%, respectively. This means that despite the intrinsic
                differences between the Moon and Ceres, TL works with
                encouraging results. The output of the U-Net contains predicted
                craters: it will be post-processed applying global thresholding
                for image binarization and a template matching algorithm to
                extract craters positions and radii in the pixel space.
                Post-processed craters will be counted and compared to the
                ground truth data in order to compute image segmentation
                metrics: precision, recall and F1 score. These indices will be
                computed, and their effect will be discussed for tasks such as
                automated crater cataloguing and optical navigation.

                A New Approach Based on Crater Detection and Matching for
                Self-Localization During Lunar Landings March 2022
              </h3>
              <p>
                This paper provides an approach of visual localization based on
                crater detection and matching in lunar landing missions.
                Firstly, considering that the lunar image intensity is not
                uniform, and the contrast between the bright and dark areas is
                not obvious, a multi-threshold segmentation method based on gray
                features and geometric constraints is introduced to realize
                automatic extraction of multi-scale craters. Secondly, by
                constructing a rigid transformation model, the craters in
                descent images are roughly matched with the corresponding
                craters in database. Meanwhile, an efficient method using
                re-projection errors is proposed for reducing false matches so
                as to improve the localization accuracy. Images taken by
                Changâ€™e-3 landing camera and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)
                are utilized to test the performance of the proposed approach.
